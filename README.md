# VOTEe
KEY PROBLEMS FACED :
•	Constituency under which voter ID has been issued turns out to be miles away from the constituency the user currently resides in. Conveyance to the constituency under which a citizen is registered turns out to be an issue due to varying reasons. This pulls back the voter turn out, even if not by significant numbers, certainly by numbers which could make a difference. A few thousand votes could potentially be game changing. 
•	Voting becomes a struggle for the community of people who are visually impaired. This also leads to misuse of Voter IDs, the disabled citizens easily forced into handing their Voter IDs for potential fraud and misuse.
OUR SOLUTION :
•	Create an online platform for voting , with all necessary security system in place. A major revamp we propose to the EVM, it includes an unbreachable face detection technology, wherein upon detection of more than one face by the screen, the vote is terminated and deemed invalid. For this we intend to use face detection APIs while deploying the security of Blockchain Technology to go hand in hand with it. 
•	To resolve issues faced by the citizens from the visually impaired community, we intend to integrate Voice tech into the system, creating a complete Voice based interaction for the voter with the portal. In order to move ahead with this, we plan on APIs which facilitate text to speech and speech to text.

The technology stack we intend to use are:
•	ReactJS for frontend
•	Azure blockchain server
•	Solidity for smart contracts
•	MongoDB for storing the photos for face detection.
